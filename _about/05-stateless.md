The [Stateless OpenPGP (SOP) CLI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-dkg-openpgp-stateless-cli) is a draft specification to enable users and applications to perform basic OpenPGP operations through a simplified, common command line syntax.
SOP wrappers exist around several OpenPGP implementations; in principle each SOP implementation should behave the same if given the same command line parameters.

SecureMyEmail for Windows, Mac, iOS, iPadOS, and Android implements the OpenPGP standard to encrypt email. Encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly in-app. 

Users can generate and manage keys via the built-in Advanced menu, as well as import their own through our Windows and Mac software to be distributed to all their devices, including mobile devices.

Users are free to export and use their SecureMyEmail-generated OpenPGP keys in other applications, as well as keep them forever, even if they decide to not use the service anymore.


Recipients don’t have to use SecureMyEmail, download anything, or register for anything to decrypt messages sent from a SecureMyEmail user. They may then reply, adding attachments of their own if they wish, and all communication is fully encrypted in transit, and at rest.

SecureMyEmail can provide end-to-end encryption to ANY IMAP email address, personal or business, including Gmail, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, iCloud, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.

Our free tier provides “free forever” access to email addresses ending in gmail.com, yahoo.com, or Microsoft consumer domains including outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com, msn.com including international variations of those domains.

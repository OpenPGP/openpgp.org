üõ°Ô∏è FlowCrypt offers different simple and convenient email encryption solutions. We provide end-to-end asymmetric encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read the encrypted content. This means that even if intercepted during transmission or stored on email servers, your messages remain secure and unreadable to anyone without the corresponding private key. Our products include:

* [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flowcrypt-encrypt-gmail-w/bnjglocicdkmhmoohhfkfkbbkejdhdgc)
* [Brave Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flowcrypt-encrypt-gmail-w/bnjglocicdkmhmoohhfkfkbbkejdhdgc)
* [Firefox Extension](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cryptup-release/firefox/cryptup-io-firefox-8.4.8.xpi)

* [iOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowcrypt-encrypted-email/id1591754995)

üíº We also offer [Enterprise](https://flowcrypt.com/docs/technical/enterprise-server/latest/technical-overview.html) solutions for key and user management:

üîí We at FlowCrypt believe in transparency and extensive collaboration as a foundation for robust and secure systems. We run a public [Bug Bounty Program](https://flowcrypt.com/docs/technical/security/bug-bounty.html) and you can also check the [list of vulnerabilities](https://flowcrypt.com/docs/technical/security/fixed-vulnerabilities.html) that have already been found and fixed. Our code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FlowCrypt), so you can review it and even become a contributor.
